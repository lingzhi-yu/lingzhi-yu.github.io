<p>This work contributes to answering the question of when the lonely (vs. non-lonely) would be more or less likely
to bond with robotic companions to fulfill social needs. We investigate the joint effect of users’ levels of
loneliness (human-side influencing factor) and robot dominance (robot-side influencing factor) on users’ attitudes
toward companion robots.</p>

<p>Six studies reveal that individuals experiencing greater loneliness generally hold less favorable attitudes toward
adopting robotic companionship. However, lonelier individuals show a <strong>higher inclination to bond with submissive
robots rather than dominant ones</strong>. These findings highlight boundary conditions for consumer–robot relationships
and inform the design of social robots for vulnerable populations.</p>
