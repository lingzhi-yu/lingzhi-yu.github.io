<p>This work contributes to answering the question of when the lonely (vs. non-lonely) 
would be more or less likely to bond with robotic companions to fulfill social needs. 
We investigate the joint effect of users’ levels of loneliness (human-side influencing 
factor) and robot dominance (robot-side influencing factor) on users’ attitudes toward 
companion robots.</p>

<p>Six studies reveal that individuals experiencing greater loneliness generally hold 
less favorable attitudes toward adopting robotic companionship. However, lonelier 
individuals show a <strong>higher inclination to bond with submissive robots rather than 
dominant ones.</strong></p>
