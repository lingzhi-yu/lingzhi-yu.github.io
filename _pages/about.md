I am Lingzhi Yu, a PhD student in Marketing, specializing in Consumer Behavior, at the University of Texas at Austin. 

My research examines how consumers process and act on information in technology-mediated environments, with a focus on gaps between intentions and actions. I study contexts such as feedback seeking, news sharing, and livestream commerce to understand when and why people mispredict their own reactions and how technology—from generative AI to real-time platforms—can reshape these dynamics. I also explore how human–AI relationships and social norms influence adoption and decision-making.

Broadly, my work aims to advance theory on consumer information use while offering insights into how firms can design communication, technologies, and marketplaces that better support consumer well-being.
