title: "The honesty gap in feedback seeking"
collection: research

excerpt: |
  with Rajagopal Raghunathan and Andrew Gershoff
 
  This project investigates the intentionâ€“action gap in feedback seeking, where people say they want honest but critical feedback yet often choose supportive but 
  politely dishonest feedback instead. We examine why this reluctance to seek or accept honest feedback is greater than anticipated and explore its implications 
  for decision-making and interpersonal dynamics.
