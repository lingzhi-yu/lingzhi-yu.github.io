excerpt: |
  This work investigates how loneliness (human-side factor) and robot dominance (robot-side factor)
  shape people’s attitudes toward adopting companion robots. Across six studies, we show that
  greater loneliness generally lowers adoption attitudes toward robotic companionship, yet lonelier
  individuals display a stronger inclination to bond with **submissive** (vs. dominant) robots.

This work contributes to answering the question of when the lonely (vs. non-lonely) would be more or less likely
to bond with robotic companions to fulfill social needs. We investigate the joint effect of users’ levels of
loneliness (human-side influencing factor) and robot dominance (robot-side influencing factor) on users’ attitudes
toward companion robots.

Six studies reveal that individuals experiencing greater loneliness generally hold less favorable attitudes toward
adopting robotic companionship. However, lonelier individuals show a **higher inclination to bond with submissive
robots rather than dominant ones**. These findings highlight boundary conditions for consumer–robot relationships
and inform the design of social robots for vulnerable populations.
