  This work investigates how loneliness (human-side factor) and robot dominance (robot-side factor)
  shape people’s attitudes toward adopting companion robots. Across six studies, we show that
  greater loneliness generally lowers adoption attitudes toward robotic companionship, yet lonelier
  individuals display a stronger inclination to bond with **submissive** (vs. dominant) robots.
