  This work contributes to answering the question of when the lonely (vs. non-lonely) 
  would be more or less likely to bond with robotic companions to fulfill social needs. 
  We investigate the joint effect of users’ loneliness (human-side influencing factor) 
  and robot dominance (robot-side influencing factor) on users’ attitudes toward 
  companion robots.

This work contributes to answering the question of when the lonely (vs. non-lonely) would be more or less likely to bond with robotic companions to fulfill social needs. We investigate the joint effect of users’ levels of loneliness (human-side influencing factor) and robot dominance (robot-side influencing factor) on users’ attitudes toward companion robots.  Six studies reveal that individuals experiencing greater loneliness hold generally less favorable attitudes toward the idea of adopting robotic companionship. However, lonelier individuals show a higher inclination to bond with robots that act **submissive rather than dominant** ones.
