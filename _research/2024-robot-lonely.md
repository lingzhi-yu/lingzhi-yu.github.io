  This work contributes to answering the question of when the lonely (vs. non-lonely) would be more or less likely
  to bond with robotic companions to fulfill social needs. We investigate the joint effect of users’ levels of
  loneliness (human-side influencing factor) and robot dominance (robot-side influencing factor) on users’ attitudes
  toward companion robots.
  Six studies reveal that individuals experiencing greater loneliness generally hold less favorable attitudes toward
  adopting robotic companionship. However, lonelier individuals show a **higher inclination to bond with submissive
  robots rather than dominant ones**. These findings highlight boundary conditions for consumer–robot relationships
  and inform the design of social robots for vulnerable populations.
