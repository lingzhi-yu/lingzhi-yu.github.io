  This research shows how reciprocal expectations in communal versus exchange relationships shape gift givers’ goals and choices. When selecting gifts for communal (exchange) recipients, 
  dominant altruistic (vs. egocentric) motives drive people to depend more strongly on rational analyses (intuition) and prefer products superior on cognitive (affective) attributions. 
  Moreover, when primed to be rational by anticipating immediate recipient evaluation, givers favored cognitively 
  superior products regardless of relationship context.
