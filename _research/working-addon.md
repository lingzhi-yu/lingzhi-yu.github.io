  Mandatory add-on fees (e.g., convenience, processing, cleaning) are increasingly common, and the labels used to describe them strongly shape consumer perceptions. Across six experiments, we show that some labels (e.g.,       “convenience”) are seen as more opaque than others (e.g., “cleaning”), reducing purchase intentions because consumers trust retailers less. Explaining opaque fees or linking them to reputable retailers reduces this           aversion. These findings position perceived opaqueness as a key driver of consumer responses to fees and highlight simple interventions to mitigate negative effects.
