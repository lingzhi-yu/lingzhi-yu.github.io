  with Bowen Ruan and Bingyan Hu, under review at *Journal of Consumer Research* 
 
  In the Information Age, people consume vast amounts of information, yet research on the consumption of information itself is limited. This research uncovers a counterintuitive 
  strategy: briefly delaying the disclosure of personally relevant good news increases total happiness. Across seven experiments in varied contexts, we show that delayed disclosure 
  sustains the desire to share, boosting happiness through hedonic segregation, reduced adaptation, and anticipation. Ironically, most people choose immediate disclosure, mistakenly 
  predicting it will yield greater happiness.
